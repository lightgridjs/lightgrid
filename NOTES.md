## Todo

- Column resizing
- Column re-ordering
- Row re-ordering
- Column filtering
- Column sorting
- Global filtering (searching)
- Cell editing
- SolidJS support
- Safely limit row/col window range
- Grid overlay prop - allows you to place a loading view etc over grid

### Docs

- Can we consume TS Props in docs?
- Getting started docs
- Column docs
- Make docs/ as markdown and use Codesandbox etc embeded examples?
- Theming (create theme builder UI too)
- Master-details example
- Tree data example

### Post MVP

- Row resizing

## Bugs

- Clicking in row details selects closest parent cell. Don't change selection on item details clicks.

## Later

- Merge header and body areas (and introduce concept of col/row spanning)?
