# Lightgrid Core

You don't need to use the core unless you are adding support for an unsupported framework.

Lightgrid is a headless datagrid with a focus on:

- Performance
- Lightweight (<25kb gzip with all plugins enabled. 10-60x smaller than other datagrids with comparable featuresets)
- Stateless, declarative, small, intuitive API
- Unopinionated UI (render your own controls, filters etc)
- Native rendering: each framework is fully responsible for rendering
