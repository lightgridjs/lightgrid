# Cell Editing

Cell editing can be achieved by creating custom cell renderers.

In this demo we create a custom cell component which:

1. Renders a read-only cell
1. Listens to double click
1. On click, renders an edit cell
1. As the user types the edit state is kept internal to the cell. If the user presses enter it is commited via `onCommit` which updates the data. If the user presses Escape the changes are cancelled.
1. The cell then returns the read-only mode
