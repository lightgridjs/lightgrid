# Detail Rows

In order to show row details we need to:

1. Add an expansion column (`columns`)

1. Tell the grid whether a row has a child details row (`getRowMeta`)

1. Choose whatever you want to render in this details row (`renderRowDetails`)

1. Pass in `rowState` and `setRowState` so that the grid knows whether to render a details row (expanded), and so our expansion column can toggle the expansion state.
