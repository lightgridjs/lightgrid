# Row Sorting

## Grid props

### onColumnsChange

As with anything where the state of the columns can be changed, you must also implement the `onColumnsChange` prop to update the column state (see the code examples below).

### multiSort

Allow sorting by multiple columns (see section below).

## Column props

There are 4 column props which control sorting:

### sortable

Whether or not this column can be sorted. This is the only prop you need to set yourself.

### sortDirection

The sort direction of this column (or undefined for no sort). You can set this to start off with a sort, but otherwise it will be set as the user toggles sorting on the columns

### createSortComparator

Passes the current `SortDirection` and expects you to return a function which
sorts the data. If this isn't specified then the built in sort function will be used.

### sortPriority

When sorting by multiple columns this determines which column is sorted first. Columns with lower values are sorted first. Usually you don't need to worry about setting this manually.

## Sorting by multiple columns

In some case you may wish to sort by multiple columns. In this case pass `multiSort=true` into the Datagrid.

You can also control which column has sort priority by setting the `sortPriority` on the column. Lower values have higher priority. By default the sort priority will be set for you based on which column the user sorted first.
