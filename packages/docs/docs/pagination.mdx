# Pagination

## Finite Pagination

When you know the length of your data you can use standard pagination navigation controls to go back, forwards, first, last etc.

<Demo demoPath="finite-pagination" srcPath="FinitePagination.tsx" />

## Infinite pagination

In cases where you don't know the total data count you can lazily load more data. Usually the server will implement offset or cursor based pagination to allow you to get the next <em>n</em> batch of items until it tells you there are no more.
